<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Sophomore at MNSU Mankato majoring in Computer Science. I love computers and my goal is to become a Software Developer at one of the biggest tech companies in the world.</p>

<p>I am just getting into web development and this is the first HTML project I have done in almost four years.I am liking it alot thus far.</p>

<p>I hope to make a cool portfolio website at the end of this course to showcase real interactive projects I will be building in the future.</p>
